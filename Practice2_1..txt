DISTINCT = A command that suppresses duplicates

Concatenation Operator (' || ') = Links two columns together to form one character data column

Literal values = A group of character data

DESCRIBE(or abrreviation is DESC) = An SQL plus command that displays the structure of a table

Try it/Solve it
1)SELECT DISTINCT last_name AS "Last_name ||' , mailing adress:'|| mailing_adress
  FROM F_CUSTOMERS;

2)a.SELECT first_name
    FROM f_staffs;

  b.SELECT first_name ||' ' || last_name AS "DJs on Demand Clients"
    FROM d_clients;

  c.SELECT DISTINCT quantity
    FROM f_order_lines;

  d.SELECT order_number
    FROM f_orders;

3) SELECT '***' ||first_name||' *** '||first_name||' ***' as "Super Star"
   FROM f_staffs;

4) SELECT first_name, DISTINCT birthdate
  FROM f_staffs
  D.No rows because distinct must be placed immediately after SELECT and in this case we have an error

5)SELECT DISTINCT last_name AS "EMPLOYEE LAST NAME", salary as "CURRENT SALARY", salary+(0.05*salary) AS "SALARY WITH 5% RAISE"
  FROM f_staffs;

6) DESCRIBE employees;
 Columns marked are "nullable" are:FIRST_NAME,PHONE_NUMBER,SALARY, COMMISSION_PCT, MANAGER_ID, DEPARTMENT_ID, BONUS. 
 "Nullable" means that these columns accepts null value. 

7) SELECT cd_number AS "Inventory Item", title AS "CD Title", producer as "Music Producer", year as "Year Purchased" 
FROM D_CDs;

8) True, tested in SQL commands.

9)True, tested in SQL commands.

10) SELECT employee_id, last_name,
    salary * 12 "ANNUAL SALARY"
    FROM employees;

we don't have comma after "last_name", "x" is not operator for multiplication,
"sal" doesn't exist, correct is salary, and we have " " at "ANNUAL SALARY"

11) Multiplication is the first evaluated.

12) SELECT b) * is the correct answer.

13) b.projection is the correct answer.

14) c. Employee is the correct answer

15) b)SELECT salary* (6 + 100) is the correct answer.
I try with a salary = 10 and I have the following results:
a) 160 , b) 1060, c) 660, d) 610 and so the correct answer is b

16) c) is the correct answer

17) a)TRUE- we can write in SQL SELECT LAST_NAME or SELECT last_name, both is correct.
    b)FALSE, I write SELECT and FROM on the separate lines.
    c)TRUE, exception is DESCRIBE is a keyword and it can be abreviated at DESC
    d)FALSE, Keyword in SQL are written in UPPERCASE.

18) b and d are the correct answers, I tested in SQL commands.

19) a. fails because keyword SELECT is not written correctly. 

20)SELECT '+++' ||first_name||' +++ '||first_name||' +++' as "Super Star"
   FROM f_staffs;
